# Design Document

## Overview

The data engineer portfolio will be a modern, single-page application (SPA) with a dark theme aesthetic inspired by the provided design template. The portfolio will feature smooth scrolling navigation, interactive elements, and a professional layout that emphasizes technical expertise while maintaining visual appeal. The design will leverage contemporary web technologies to create an engaging user experience that reflects the engineer's technical sophistication.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom dark theme configuration
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and scroll-triggered animations
- **Icons**: React Icons library for consistent iconography
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify for fast, reliable hosting with CI/CD integration

  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  longDescription: string;
  technologies: string[];
  category: 'data-pipeline' | 'analytics' | 'ml-ops' | 'infrastructure';
  image: string;
  liveUrl?: string;
  githubUrl?: string;
  achievements: string[];
  timeline: string;
}

```

## Data Models

### Content Management
- Static JSON files for easy content updates
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Modular data structure for scalability
- Image optimization and lazy loading

### SEO and Meta Data
- Dynamic meta tags for social sharing
- Open Graph protocol implementation
- Structured data markup for search engines
- Sitemap generation for better indexing

## Error Handling

### User Experience
- Graceful degradation for JavaScript-disabled browsers
- Loading states for dynamic content
- Error boundaries for React component failures
- Fallback images for broken or missing assets

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting for faster initial load
- Image optimization and WebP format support
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Service worker for offline functionality

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for interactive elements

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Test coverage for all interactive components
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- Mock data for isolated component testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

### Accessibility Testing
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing
- Color contrast validation

## Design System

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep navy (#0f172a) and charcoal (#1e293b)
- Accent: Electric blue (#3b82f6) and cyan (#06b6d4)
- Text: White (#ffffff) and light gray (#e2e8f0)
- Success/Error: Green (#10b981) and red (#ef4444)

### Typography
- Primary: Inter or Poppins for headings
- Secondary: Source Code Pro for code snippets
- Body: System font stack for optimal performance
- Font sizes: Responsive scale from 14px to 48px

### Spacing and Layout
- 8px grid system for consistent spacing
- Container max-width: 1200px
- Responsive breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Consistent padding and margins throughout

### Interactive Elements
